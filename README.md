# README
A repository for Vault setup in my home lab. A modest [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) serves as the host for my home lab Vault instance.  It runs on my home wifi network somehwere (easily portable).  It is accessible without much fuss at <https://vault.tenzin.cloud>.
